Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
adapted from a verse by Polhané Sonam Tobgyé

gangri rawé korwé shyingkham su
In the heavenly realm of Tibet, surrounded by a chain of snow mountains,
pen dang dewa malü jungwé né
The source of all happiness and help for beings
chenrezik wang tenzin gyatso yi
Is Tenzin Gyatso—Chenrezik in person—
shyabpé kal gyé bardu ten gyur chik
May his life be secure for hundreds of kalpas!

Adapted from a verse composed by Polhané Sonam Tobgyé (1689–1747) for the Seventh Dalai Lama,
Kalzang Gyatso (1708–1757).
