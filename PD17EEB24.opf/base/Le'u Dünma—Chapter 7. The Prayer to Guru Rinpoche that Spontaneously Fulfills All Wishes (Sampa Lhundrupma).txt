Chapter Seven: The Prayer to Guru Rinpoche that Spontaneously Fulfils All Wishes (Sampa Lhundrupma)

revealed by Tulku Zangpo Drakpa


Namo Guru: Homage to the Guru!
When the master Padmasambhava was leaving for the land of the rakṣasa ogres in the south-west,
on the heights of Gungthang, the prince Mutri Tsenpo offered prostrations and circumambulated
him. He placed the guru’s feet on the crown of his head, and clutching at the edge
of his robe, with tears streaming down his face, he offered him this mournful song:
“Kyema! O Guru Rinpoche!  In this final five hundred year age, here at Gungthang, in Mangyul,
alongside the snow ranges, my family and lineage have settled. If we sink to the level of
the common people, and we are plunged into misery, pity the kings of Tibet!  Who will my
family turn to?
“Fighting and violence will be the common lot. The great isolated hermitages will be torn down;
mountains and valley will become the haunts of bandits. When no one has the time to practise
Dharma, masters and their patrons will face trouble and hardship. Pity those with faith
in times to come!
“Temples will become battlegrounds; holy objects, statues, texts and stupas will be destroyed;
sacred items will be profaned by lay people; remote hermitages will ring with the invocation
of magicians. When monasteries and temples are on the verge of annihilation, the entire
culture of Buddhadharma will face ruin. Who can we turn to then, to protect the Dharma?
“The great and revered will be murdered by poison; the powerful will be assassinated; the best
will be dragged down by the lawless to the lowest level; when dearest friends betray us,
pity the royal ministers of Tibet! Who can then be trusted by the king?
“Sickness, war and famine will spread; armies from the borderlands invade; ghosts, obstructors
and jungpo demons suddenly run rampant. When everything unwanted arises, pity the people
of Tibet in their suffering! Who can they turn to, sentient beings with no protector?
“Trisong Detsen has passed away; the Guru is leaving for the land of Orgyen; Mutri Tsenpo is
to be abandoned in Tibet!
“The king my father’s life was cut short; so be it! The Guru’s compassion is so scant; so be
it! My merit is so meagre; so be it! The monasteries and teachings fall into decline; so
be it! The Tibetan people’s happiness is at an end; so be it!
“Why on earth did Mutri Tsenpo not die while my father and the guru were here? Who can I rely
on now? Who will give me loving advice? Who can I ask for teachings? When I am dying, who
will transfer my consciousness? In the bardo, who will dispel my suffering? When I am dead,
who will perform the practices to purify my obscurations?
“Kyema! Kyihü! What little compassion!”
With this, the prince let out a grief-stricken sigh and fainted. The master Padmākara spat into
his ear, so as to revive him. Then he gently laid the prince’s head in his lap, and said
these words:
“Listen, king of Tibet, faithful one! Destined and devoted son of mine!
“Know that Trisong Detsen’s life had reached its natural end. So do not despair, prince and
lord of Tibet.
“Still I shall come for the benefit of Tibet, to those who have devotion, I shall appear in
person to teach the Dharma. So do not despair, prince and lord of Tibet.
“All your negative actions and obscurations, every one, will for certain be purified by just
seeing my face. So do not despair, prince and lord of Tibet.
“In this life, the next and in the bardo state, you will meet me again and again, and your suffering
will be dispelled. So do not despair, prince and lord of Tibet.
“You will accomplish the benefit of beings during sixteen lifetimes after this one, then you
will go to Orgyen, realm of the ḍākinīs. So do not despair, prince and lord of Tibet.
“On these slopes of the snow peaks of Gungthang in Mangyul, your descendants will in future
rule unfailingly according to Dharma. My compassion will gaze upon them all uninterruptedly.
So do not despair, prince and lord of Tibet.
“When disciples with faith and devotion practise in retreat, and they live in accord with the
words of the Buddha, they will be protected by my blessing and my compassion. So do not
despair, prince and lord of Tibet.
“Unfortunate ones, demonic with their evil actions and wrong views, sentient beings bent on
harm, doubting and jealously finding fault, cannot enjoy my protection, but only the results
of their harmful actions. Even these evil ministers at present in power who trouble the
mind of the king and violate their samaya vow with me, will go to the three lower realms,
that is certain, but having seen my face, having heard my voice, when their last negative
karma is purified, they’ll be born as my disciples. So do not despair, prince and lord of
Tibet.
“When this degenerate age reaches its end, at the eastern foot of Mount Trazang, because of
his aspirations, a hidden yogi will reveal my terma treasure, and protect your family line.
So do not despair, prince and lord of Tibet.
“Sentient beings in this final dark age are duped by false guides, and, because of this error,
are stuck in the swamp of wrong views. Unable to distinguish Dharma from what merely looks
like Dharma, they are plagued by doubts.
“He who will appear at the foot of Mount Trazang is a hidden yogi who practises the virtuous
way, utterly in keeping with the teachings of the secret mantra Mahāyāna. He will certainly
protect the king of Gungthang and his subjects, so do not despair, prince and lord of Tibet.”
And so he spoke. This was the occasion in which the Guru gave the teaching called, ‘The Self-liberation
of Negative Emotions', which dispelled the suffering of the king.
Then he spoke once more:
“O prince, because of your exceptional kindness toward your subjects, with my blessing and compassion,
I shall give refuge to your royal line until the very end of the dregs of time.
O prince, to you and your subjects, I leave this final advice:
“This divine lineage of Clear Light, noble and authentic, from Mutri Tsenpo onwards and for
as long as this family line continues, I shall hold constantly in my compassion.
“Do not listen to advice from manipulative friends or ministers whose actions are evil. Nourish
your civil laws with the principles of Dharma. People devoid of spiritual values, stubborn,
cunning and deceptive, will appear in this dark age; defeat them and establish the laws
of Dharma. By acting according to the teachings, the kingdom will flourish in happiness
and peace.
“If your life is in danger, your power is being usurped, and king is brought down to commoner,
make the gods and spirits be your witness and act to avert such crises.
“In the dregs of time, because of my compassion for the king of Gungthang, on the slope of the
rock mountain, in a place shaped like a heap of poisonous snakes, I leave the pith instructions
that will protect the prince’s descendants.
“Then, when human beings are engulfed by doubts, do not have wrong views, follow my instructions,
and the wishes of the king of Gungthang will be fulfilled.
“Kings who commit evil do not receive my protection.”
This is what he said.
Then the Guru spoke once more:
“A time will come when the very last of the prince’s line at Mangyul Gungthang will be protected
by my terma. This will be a time when suffering will come to Tibet, when sentient beings
will encounter everything they do not want. Up above, the gods and demons will be thrown
into chaos and turmoil; down below, the nāgas and nyens will be cast into turmoil; in-between,
the local deities will be pitched into turmoil; rulers who perpetrate evil will writhe
in turmoil; ordinary people will be plunged into turmoil; parents, siblings and children
will fight one another so whole families will be embroiled into turmoil. This will be
the time when the teaching of Buddha will be reaching its end. The siddhis of the yidam deities
will fade. Ḍākinīs and dharmapālas will look away, and turn towards Mount Meru. The
happiness of sentient beings will have come to an end.
“King of Gungthang, patrons of the Dharma, ruler and subjects, carry out my instructions and
practise this treasure teaching. For this is when my compassion, Padma’s compassion, will
come, ever more swift and strong. Pray to me, constantly:
emaho, nubchok dewachen gyi shyingkham su

So he spoke, and thinking of the prince with great fondness, he gave him thirteen pith instructions
which are like wish-fulfilling jewels. The prince then prostrated and circumambulated
in devotion. Gazing towards Orgyen, the Guru departed, riding on a ray of sunlight.
The prince Mutri Tsenpo concealed the pith instruction on ‘Self-Liberation of Destructive Emotions’,
and the pith instructions akin to wish-fulfilling jewels, along with Guru Rinpoche’s
final advice, as treasures, in the rock resembling a pile of jewels (Drak Rinchen Pung
Dra) in Mangyul. He entrusted it to the terma custodians, the four sisters of Séi Lhamo.
These were his words:
“When the final moment has come, and it is time for my royal line to suffer, on the eastern
slope of Mount Trazang a being with the karmic destiny will come. Then let him find this,
and let my line be protected!”
Prince Mutri Tsenpo said:
“My faithful and devoted people, recite ‘The Prayer to the Three Kāya Guru’ whenever you recall
the master, your refuge.
“Recite the prayer given to King Trisong Detsen, my father, in the evening, the time of wrath.
“Recite the prayer given to Lady Tsogyal before first light, early in the morning, the time
of increase.
“Recite the prayer given to gelong Namkhé Nyingpo at dawn, the time for pacifying.
“Recite the prayer given to Nanam Dorjé Dudjom in the afternoon, the time for magnetizing and
power.
“Recite the prayer given to Prince Mutri Tsenpo in the darkness of midnight.
“Recite the Sampa Lhundrupma, the prayer given to the king of Gungthang, at midday, during rest.
“In general, recite these prayers whenever you feel threatened by suffering.
“To me and my unbroken royal line, and to those with the good fortune of acting according to
Dharma, in general, all the buddhas are extremely kind: in particular, the Guru is inconceivably
kind. So listen to my words, the words of a king who protects the Dharma: pray to
the Guru constantly, and with deep devotion.”
These were his words. This prayer taught to the king of Gungthang, called ‘The Spontaneous Fulfilment
of Wishes’ was concealed by Mutri Tsenpo in the temple of Rulak Gyang. The terma
custodian to whom he entrusted it was Lhamo Dréu Shyönma.
In the Male Water Dragon year (1352), Tulku Zangpo Drakpa took out the terma from the temple
of Rulak Gyang, and entrusted it to the great vidyādhara Rigdzin Chenpo Gödem Truchen (1337-1408),
who deciphered it from the ḍākinī code.
