In this way, to the Awakened One, the transcendent Lord,

The single eye of wisdom, entirely unobscured,

The light of wisdom, forever shining brightly,

To you, Arapacana, I pay homage.
yeshe ku nyi khyé la dü
To you, the very embodiment of wisdom, I bow.
dzokpé sangye kün gyi shé
Thus it is explained by all the perfect buddhas.
chomdendé jampal yeshe sempé döndampé tsen yangdakpar jöpé nyingpo
This concludes this teaching, spoken by the transcendent lord Śākyamuni:
chomdendé deshyin shekpa shakya tubpé shyal né sungpa dzok so
the Essence of the Perfect Recitation of the Names of the Wisdom Being, the Transcendent Lord
Mañjuśrī.

This is a terma. Guru Rinpoche proclaimed to Jomo Shedrön that reciting this prayer is equal
to reciting the whole of the Mañjuśrī Nāma Saṃgīti. Have no doubt that it will bring accomplishment
within a single month.
