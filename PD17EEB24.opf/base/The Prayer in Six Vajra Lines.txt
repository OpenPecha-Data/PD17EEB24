The Prayer in Six Vajra Lines
revealed by Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa

dü sum sangye guru rinpoche
Embodiment of buddhas of past, present and future, Guru Rinpoche;
ngödrub kün dak dewa chenpö shyab
Master of all siddhis, Guru of Great Bliss;
barché kün sel düdul drakpo tsal
Dispeller of all obstacles, Wrathful Subjugator of Māras;
solwa deb so jingyi lab tu sol
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessing,
chi nang sangwé barché shyiwa dang
So that outer, inner and secret obstacles are dispelled
sampa lhün gyi drubpar jingyi lob
And all my aspirations are spontaneously fulfilled.

Discovered by the great terma-revealer Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa, from the right-hand side of the
Sengchen Namdrak rock on Mount Rinchen Tsekpa, ‘The Pile of Jewels’. Because the blessing
of this prayer, one intended for this present time, is so immense, it should be treasured
by all as their daily practice.
