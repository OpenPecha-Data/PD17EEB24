Without any question, the great treasure revealer Orgyen Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa manifested specifically
for this time. From below the foot of the Great Awesome One at the door of Danyin
Khala Rong, he revealed the ‘Quintessential Manual of Oral Instructions: the Wish-fulfilling
Jewel’ from ‘The Guru’s Heart Practice: Dispelling All Obstacles’—Lamé Tukdrup Barché
Kunsel. This prayer forms the outer practice of this revelation.
May this prayer become the cause for pacifying completely all the obstacles and degeneration
for both the teachings and beings, and accomplishing all the aims of virtue and goodness!
Maṅgalaṃ!
