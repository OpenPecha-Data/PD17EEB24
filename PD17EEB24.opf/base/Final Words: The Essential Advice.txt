Final Words: The Essential Advice
by Minling Terchen Gyurme Dorje

The supreme refuge, the lord of the maṇḍala, whose name is difficult to utter, the great tertön
and sovereign of Dharma, Drodul Terdak Lingpa, as he demonstrated the act of dissolving
his illusory nirmāṇakāya manifestation into the sphere of ultimate reality, spoke the following
words of advice:
nang drak rik sum lha ngak chökü ngang
May appearance, sound and awareness in the state of deity, mantra and dharmakāya
ku dang yeshe rolpar jamlepé
Merge boundlessly as the display of kāyas and wisdoms,
zabsang naljor chenpö nyamlen la
In the profound and secret practice of the great yoga,
yermé tuk kyi tikler ro chik shok
And may they be of one taste, indivisible within the sphere of the enlightened mind.

Written by Gyurme Dorje.
May this prayer of aspiration for sealing the body, speech and mind of all this great master's
fortunate followers, headed by his spiritual and familial heirs, within the indestructible
body, speech and mind of enlightenment, be fulfilled!
